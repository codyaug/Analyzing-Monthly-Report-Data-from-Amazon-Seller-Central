# Forecast Amazon ASIN Rankings
This project analyzes a monthly report data by loading it into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file named "monthly_report.csv". The frequency of each ASIN is counted and plotted as a bar graph. The report data is then grouped by keyword and the frequency of each keyword is calculated and plotted as a trend graph. An ARIMA model is trained on the keyword data to forecast future trends and the forecasted trend is plotted. A decision tree is trained on the ASIN data to predict future rankings and the predicted rankings of each ASIN are plotted in a scatter plot.
