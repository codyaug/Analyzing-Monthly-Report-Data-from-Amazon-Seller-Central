# Forecast Amazon ASIN Rankings
I am a data analyst who is proficient in using Python and its libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data analysis and visualization. I have expertise in processing and analyzing monthly report data using the above mentioned libraries. My code loads a monthly report data into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file, counts the frequency of each ASIN in the report and plots it as a bar graph. I also group the report data by keyword, calculate the frequency of each keyword, and plot the trend of each keyword. To forecast future trends, I train an ARIMA model on the keyword data and plot the forecasted trend. I also train a decision tree on the ASIN data to predict future rankings and plot the predicted rankings of each ASIN.
